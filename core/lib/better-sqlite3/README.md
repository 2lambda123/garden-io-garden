# better-sqlite3

These are pre-built binaries for [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3). Unfortunately we need this while they're not bundling these binaries. See issues [#452](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/452), [#439](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/439) and [#438](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/issues/438) in their repo.
