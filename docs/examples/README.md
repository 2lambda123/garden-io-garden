# Example projects

## [Demo project](./demo-project.md)

Here we see how to "gardenify" a pre-existing project, creating a project config and the individual module configs for every part.

## [TLS project](./tls-project.md)

This is an example project of how to set up TLS using the `mkcert` tool.

## [Remote sources project](./remote-sources.md)

This project demonstrates how to use multiple sources and repositories together into the same project. Although in this project we're using _remote_ sources, the same applies to using multiple _local_ repositories.

## [Using Garden in CI](./using-garden-in-ci.md)

In this example we demonstrate how to use Garden in a CI pipeline to run tests and deploy to preview and staging environments. Note that you'll need to have a remote Kubernetes cluster set up to complete the steps in the guide.
