# Hot Reload

When the `local-kubernetes` or `kubernetes` provider is used, `container` modules can be configured to hot-reload their running services when the module's sources change (i.e. without redeploying). In essence, hot-reloading copies source files into the appropriate running containers (local or remote) when code is changed by the user.

For example, services that can be run with a file system watcher that automatically update the running application process when sources change (e.g. nodemon, Django, Ruby on Rails, and many other web app frameworks) are a natural fit for this feature.

# Usage

Currently, services are only deployed with hot reloading enabled when their names are passed to the `--hot` option via `garden deploy` or `garden dev` commands (e.g. `garden dev --hot=foo-service,bar-service`). If these services don't belong to a module defining a `hotReload` configuration (see below for an example), an error will be thrown if their names are passed to the `--hot` option.

You can also pass `*` (e.g. `--hot=*`/`--hot-reload=*`) to deploy all compatible services with hot reloading enabled (i.e. all services belonging to a module that defines a `hotReload` configuration).

Subsequently deploying a service belonging to a module configured for hot reloading via `garden deploy` (without the watch flag) results in the service being redeployed in standard configuration.

Since hot reloading is triggered via Garden's file system watcher, hot reloading only occurs while a watch-mode Garden command is running.

# Quick example

Following is a simple example of a module configured for hot reloading:

```yaml
kind: Module
description: My Test Service
name: test-service
type: container
hotReload:
  sync:
  - target: /app/
services:
  - name: test-service
    args: [npm, start]             # runs `node main.js`
    hotReloadArgs: [npm, run, dev] # runs `nodemon main.js`
```

In the above, the `hotReload` field specifies the destination path inside the running container that the module's (top-level) directory (where its `garden.yml` resides) is synced to.

Note that only files tracked in version control are synced, e.g. respecting `.gitignore`.

If a `source` is specified along with `target`, that subpath in the module's directory is synced to the target instead of the default of syncing the module's top-level directory.

You can configure several such `source`/`target` pairs, but note that the `source` paths must be disjoint, i.e. a `source` path may not be a subdirectory of another `source` path within the same module. Here's an example:

```yaml
    sync:
      - source: /foo
        target: /app/foo
      - source: /bar
        target: /app/bar
```

Lastly, `hotReloadArgs` specifies the arguments to use to run the container (when deployed with hot reloading enabled). If no `hotReloadArgs` are specified, `args` is also used to run the container when the service is deployed with hot reloading enabled
