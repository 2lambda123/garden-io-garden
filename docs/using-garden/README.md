# Using Garden

This section contains short guides on the main Garden constructs. They're useful for those getting started with Garden but also for those that need to brush up on these concepts or that haven't started using them.

Each guide serves as a standalone introduction to the concept but it's still recommended that you go through them in order.

There's no need to finish them all at once though. By adding a [project configuration](./creating-a-project.md), [modules](./adding-modules.md), and [services](./adding-modules.md), you can already deploy your project with Garden. You can then come back when you're ready to add [tests](./running-tests.md) and [tasks](./running-tasks.md).

## [Creating a Project](./creating-a-project.md)
The first step to using Garden is to create a project level `garden.yml` configuration file. You'll learn how in this guide.

## [Adding Modules](./adding-modules.md)
Modules are the basic unit of building in Garden. In this guide you'll learn how to split your project into modules that Garden can build.

## [Adding Services](./adding-services.md)
Services are the basic unit of deployment in Garden. In this guide you'll learn how to add services to your modules so that you can deploy them.

## [Running Tests](./running-tests.md)
This guide shows you how Garden can run your tests for you.

## [Running Tasks](./running-tasks.md)
This guide shows you how Garden can run tasks for you, for example database migrations.
