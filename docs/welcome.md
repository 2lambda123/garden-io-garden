# Welcome

Welcome to the official Garden documentation site ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find (hopefully) everything you need to know on how to set up and use Garden for your development and testing workflows.

To the left you'll find all the different documentation sections. Below you'll find a high level overview of the docs, to help you get your bearings.

**If you're new to Garden and are working on setting up your project**, we recommend the following:

* Start by going through our [Quickstart Guide](./basics/quickstart.md). This will give you a basic overview of Garden's main features.
* Next, go through the [Your First Project tutorial](./tutorials/your-first-project/README.md). This tutorial helps you create configuration for an example project that you can then apply to your own. And if you get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out to our [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gxeuDgp6Xt).
* Finally, check-out our [Adopting Garden guide](./guides/adopting-garden.md) which gives you a high-level overview of how to adopt Garden and roll it out to your team.

**If your team has already set up a project for Garden**, and you just need to learn how to use the Garden CLI, you may find it helpful to skip straight to the [Installation](./basics/quickstart.md#step-1-install-garden) and [Using the CLI](./using-garden/using-the-cli.md) guides, but we do still recommend learning [How Garden Works](./basics/how-garden-works.md) and about [The Stack Graph and the general terminology](./basics/stack-graph.md).

**If you need help as an open source user**, please get in touch via [our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gxeuDgp6Xt). Our team monitors it closely, and we encourage you to reach out with questions about Garden.

**If you'd like to learn more about Garden Cloud**, please see [our website](https://garden.io/plans).

Here's a rundown of the different sections (the section links point to the first page of each section):

| Section | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **[Basics](./basics/how-garden-works.md)** | Learn the essentials of how Garden works, and the terminology involved. |
| **[Tutorials](./tutorials/your-first-project/README.md)** | Various tutorials for getting started with and using Garden. |
| **[Using Garden](./using-garden/configuration-overview.md)** | Here we dive deeper into how Garden is configured, learn more about all the concepts, as well as how to use the Garden CLI. |
| **[Plugins](./plugins/README.md)** | Here you'll learn how to get started using specific Garden plugins. All the plugin guides have similar structure that walk you through first configuring the plugin and then its module types. |
| **[Guides](./guides/README.md)** | These get into more specific use cases, and more details on how to configure Garden for certain scenarios. |
| **[Advanced](./advanced/using-remote-sources.md)** | Similar to the Guides section, but generally more advanced use cases. |
| **[Reference](./reference/providers/README.md)** | Look here for in-depth references for Garden commands and configuration. This includes all the available [providers](./reference/providers/README.md) and different [module types](./reference/module-types/README.md) that you can use to construct your Garden project. |
| **[Misc](./misc/faq.md)** | Find our [FAQ](./misc/faq.md) and [troubleshooting guide](./misc/troubleshooting.md) here, and anything else we couldn't fit into other sections. |

If there's something you can't find in our docs, we happily encourage you to [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/gxeuDgp6Xt) and/or file an issue on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/garden-io/garden). We're more than happy to help!
