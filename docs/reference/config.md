## garden.yml reference

Below is the full schema for the `garden.yml` configuration files. For an introduction,
please look at our [configuration guide](../using-garden/configuration-files.md).

Note that individual module types, e.g. `container`, add additional configuration keys. The built-in module types
are listed in the [Built-in module types](#built-in-module-types) section. Please refer to those for more details
on module configuration.
