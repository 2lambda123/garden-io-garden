# `octant` Provider

## Description

Adds [Octant](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant) to the Garden dashboard, as well as a `garden tools octant` command.

Below is the full schema reference for the provider configuration. For an introduction to configuring a Garden project with providers, please look at our [configuration guide](../../using-garden/configuration-overview.md).

The reference is divided into two sections. The [first section](#complete-yaml-schema) contains the complete YAML schema, and the [second section](#configuration-keys) describes each schema key.
