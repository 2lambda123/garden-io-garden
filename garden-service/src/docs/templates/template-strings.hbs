# Template string reference

Below you'll find the schema of the keys available when interpolating template strings (see our
[Configuration Files](../using-garden/configuration-files.md) guide for more information and usage examples).

Note that there are three sections below, since Project configs and Module configs have different keys available to
them, and since additional keys are available under `providers` in Project configs.
Please make sure to refer to the correct section.

Modules can reference `outputs` defined by other modules, via the `${modules.<module-name>.outputs}` key, as well
as service and task outputs via the `${runtime.services.<service-name>.outputs}` and
`${runtime.tasks.<task-name>.outputs}`.
For details on which outputs are available for a given module type, please refer to the
[reference](https://docs.garden.io/reference/module-types) docs for the module type in question, and look for the
_Outputs_ section.

## Project configuration context

The following keys are available in any template strings within project definitions in `garden.yml` config files
(see the [Provider](#provider-configuration-context) section below for additional keys available when configuring
`providers`):

```yaml
{{{projectContext}}}
```

## Provider configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings under the `providers`Â key (or `environments[].providers)
in `garden.yml` project config files:

```yaml
{{{providerContext}}}
```

## Module configuration context

The following keys are available in template strings with module definitions in `garden.yml` config files:

```yaml
{{{moduleContext}}}
```
